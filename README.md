# Blue-Bank-Loan-Analysis
As a data analyst, I have been assigned to analyze the loan data of Blue Bank. The objective of this project is to analyze the bank's loan data and build an interactive dashboard using Tableau to display some of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for loan products. To achieve this goal, I will use Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries for data wrangling and analysis.

The project will begin with collecting the loan data from the bank's database, which will be provided in CSV format. I will start by cleaning the data, removing any duplicates or missing values, and restructuring the dataset to make it more suitable for analysis. Next, I will use Pandas and NumPy libraries to analyze the data and calculate various KPIs such as the debt-to-income ratio, min/max interest rate, average loan amount, and income groups, among others.

Once I have calculated the KPIs, I will import the data into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard will include visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line charts to represent the KPIs. The dashboard will also provide filters to enable the user to interact with the data and view the KPIs for different loan products, time periods, and customer segments.

Some of the KPIs that will be displayed in the dashboard include the debt-to-income ratio, min/max interest rate, average loan amount, and income groups, among others. These KPIs will provide insights into the bank's loan portfolio performance and help identify areas for improvement.

Overall, this project will demonstrate how data analysis and visualization techniques can be used to gain insights into a bank's loan portfolio performance. The interactive dashboard will allow users to explore the data and gain insights into the bank's loan products' performance, enabling the bank to make data-driven decisions to improve its loan portfolio's performance.
